 Iterative vs Incremental: App Feature Strategy Presentation

Overview
This presentation is about Oliver’s App project. The project encompasses the development, deployment, and managing of Oliver’s App – A really cool smartphone app made for entertaining and wholesome conversation. The project aims to create the app, refine it and release it to the public. A primary project goal is to have 1,000 users and overwhelmingly positive reviews. Our vision is to help create good memories through the use of our app as human connection is incredibly valuable.
Specifically, this presentation outlines the proposal of a feature for Oliver’s app which involves using a SaaS (software as a service) product that would track user events and help us gain insights about user analytics. We have yet to pinpoint which SaaS vendor we’re going to utilize so this outline mainly pertains to how we intend to implement the software into our application.
 
Iterative Implementation Process
Were we to go with the iterative approach, we would do so by first defining the scope for what we want to get out of the SaaS in the beginning phase as well as in subsequent phases. From there we would define the enhancements we want to utilize from the SaaS and provide a timeline for when we want to have relevant milestones achieved. We would use this data to breakdown the SaaS implementation into tasks that can be performed iteratively. 
The first iteration would involve tracking some of what we would be considered to be key-events; that is moments when users use our app that contain the most valuable insights to our team. For example, we would track the length of time a user was on our app. In the next iteration we would implement SaaS features which help us learn which features of the app the users interacted with most. In follow-up iterations we would analyze user location.
Incremental Implementation Process
Were we to go with the Incremental approach, we would first layout what we want to get out of the SaaS. Then we would break down the work it would take to fully utilize the SaaS for our app into milestones. We would take those milestones, and break down each one into tasks and then determine the scale of difficulty for each one and the overall value we would gain from completing each task. Once we established a scale of difficulty and weight for each task we would create a timeline for completing the full utilization of the SaaS for our means.
 Our first increment would involve breaking down insights gained from tracking user events into categories and defining the most valuable user insights from the less valuable but still important insights. Once this is accomplished we’d begin implement the SaaS starting with the most viable category and building it out from there. Ensuring there is no loss in quality as the insights from the SaaS continue to grow.

Project Manager Thoughts
From a project management standpoint, the incremental approach was tempting but could pose a greater risk to the project timeline especially if implementing the user tracking software takes longer than anticipated. It could also be found to generate information which really isn't useful and we run the risk of wasting time and resources. By choosing the iterative approach we are able to test out the software without investing as many resources.
